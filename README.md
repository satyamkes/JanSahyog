The system collects basic user details and documents through a simple web interface.

Uploaded documents are processed using OCR to extract relevant information such as age, income, and category.

A rule-based eligibility engine compares user data with structured government scheme rules stored in the database.

Only eligible schemes are recommended, along with a clear explanation of why the user qualifies or does not qualify.

Admins can manage schemes and eligibility rules through a dedicated dashboard.
